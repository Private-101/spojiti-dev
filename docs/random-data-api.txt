V2 Documentation
Introduction
Developing and testing your web or mobile app can be hard without any data to work with. 
This is why Random Data API exists. Use any of our API endpoints and fetch data that will 
allow you faster development and testing cycle. All responses come with ID (integer) and UID (string).

For example, you can combine our users, stripe and subscription resources 
to develop and test your membership feature.

Parameters
Base URI: https://random-data-api.com/api/v2/
Use size=number to fetch an array of any resource.
Use response_type=json to render JSON or response_type=xml to render XML.
Example #1: https://random-data-api.com/api/v2/users?size=2&is_xml=true
Example #2: https://random-data-api.com/api/v2/cannabis
